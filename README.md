# Picture YYYY/MM Organizer
Simple pic YYYY/DD Organizer using image datetime metadata.

Pain Point: Typically for Android entire picture was stored in a folder. Manual organization of these folders can be very tedious. 

Plus Point: If you're like me and self-host using Nextcloud, you might be familiar with the upload organization options offered by Nextcloud app. 

Basic Description:
This organization uses Image metadata rather than filename or file modified date due to obvious reason. However, this doesnt stop the wrong date time issue generated by the original device itself. so use it with caution.

Target user:
someone who familiar with python code.

Library PrereQ:
1) shutil
2) imghdr
3) yaml
4) PIL

there 2 files:
1) yaml file: for you to specify image path
2) python code itself

to invoke simply:
```
python3 picture_mth_yr_organizer.py
```
